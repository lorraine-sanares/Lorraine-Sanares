Hi, I’m Lorraine Sanares. I’m a Student and aspiring Data Scientist based in Melbourne, Australia.

As third-year Bachelor of Science student majoring in Data Science at the University of Melbourne, I specialise in extracting powerful and impacful insights from data; implementing advanced techniques in Python, SQL and Machine Learning. I use a wide range of visualisation tools to create beautiful and user-friendly visualisations. What's my story? What challenges did I face and how did I overcome them?
